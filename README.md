# Employee-Attrition-Prediction-Model
## 📈 Project Overview
In this project, I took on the perspective and role of a data scientist at corporation that is looking to develop a predictive model that identifies employees who are most likely to leave the company. Early identification allows HR teams to implement targeted retention strategies, saving significant time, talent, and resources.

This project leverages a dataset containing various employee metrics, including:
- Job Involvement
- Education
- Job Satisfaction
- Performance Rating
- Relationship Satisfaction
- Work-Life Balance

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Employee turnover can be costly and disruptive. By using machine learning techniques, we aim to build a model that can predict employee attrition based on behavioral and performance-related factors. This prediction will help HR proactively address potential retention issues.
